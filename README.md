# 🧑‍🎓 **Student Management System** 🌐

Welcome to the **Student Management CRUD Project**! 🚀

[View Live Demo](https://babureddynr.github.io/spring-html-pages/studentmgtnikitash.html)

This project demonstrates a simple CRUD application for managing students using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**. It provides basic operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) for handling student data in a database.

---

## 🔍 **Features**:
- **Student Management** 📚: Manage students' data including Name, Roll Number, and other information.
- **CRUD Operations** ➕➖: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for students.
- **Database Integration** 🛢️: Connected to **MySQL** database for data persistence.
- **REST API** 🌐: A Spring Boot application that exposes endpoints for student operations.

---

## 🌟 **Tech Stack**:
- **Java** 🧑‍💻: Core language for application development.
- **Spring Boot** 🔧: Provides the backend structure and API management.
- **Hibernate** 🛠️: ORM tool for database interactions.
- **MySQL** 🗃️: Database for storing student data.
- **Maven** 🔄: Dependency management and build tool.

## 🚀 **How to Run Locally**:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/babureddynr/STUDENT-MGT-SPRINGS.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd STUDENT-MGT-SPRINGS
   ```

3. Make sure your MySQL database is set up. Update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

4. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. Once the application is running, you can test the CRUD operations by sending requests to the respective endpoints:
   - **GET** `/students` - Retrieve all students.
   - **POST** `/students` - Add a new student.
   - **PUT** `/students/{id}` - Update an existing student's data.
   - **DELETE** `/students/{id}` - Delete a student.

---

## 🌐 **Endpoints**:

- **GET** `/students` - Fetch all students.
- **POST** `/students` - Create a new student.
- **PUT** `/students/{id}` - Update student details.
- **DELETE** `/students/{id}` - Remove a student from the database.

---

## 🛠️ **Project Preview**:
- You can test the CRUD functionality using tools like **Postman** or **curl** to interact with the REST API.

---

## ✨ **Improvements to Add**:
- Implement more advanced features such as pagination and sorting.
- Add validation for the input fields before performing operations.
- Implement authentication and authorization for secure access.
- Improve exception handling and error responses.
